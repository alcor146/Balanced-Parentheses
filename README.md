# Balanced-Parentheses
I am basically ignoring every commented line and replace the content of the most deep curly brackets with 3 dots while  making sure they are balanced

I use the dequeue to make sure they are balanced
I add all the positions of the most inner curly bracket in an arraylist and clear it every time a find a deeper level bracket to avoid going over the string 2 times
(not sure if its better or not but oh well).
